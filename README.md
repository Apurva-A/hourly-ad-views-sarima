# SARIMA Ads Forecasting <br>
This repository implements a Seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA) model to forecast the number of "ads watched per hour". It provides Python code for:

Data Loading and Preprocessing: Load and prepare time series data on ad views. <br>
SARIMA Model Fitting: Optimize and fit a SARIMA model to the historical data. <br>
Forecasting Future Values: Use the fitted model to predict the number of "ads watched per hour" for future steps. <br>
Visualization and Evaluation: Generate plots to visualize the actual data, fitted values (optional), and forecasted values. The code might also include metrics to evaluate the model's performance. <br>
## Key Features:

Leverages Python libraries like pandas and statsmodels.tsa.statespace for time series analysis and SARIMA modeling.<br>
Offers a clear and concise implementation for ad view forecasting with SARIMA.<br>
Provides a foundation for customization by adjusting model parameters and incorporating additional functionalities.<br>
## Target Audience:

Data scientists and analysts interested in applying SARIMA for time series forecasting.<br>
Developers working with ad platforms or media analytics who want to predict future ad engagement.<br>
Anyone interested in learning about SARIMA and its application to real-world problems.<br>
